I'm Saket Pradhanâ€”a software developer, chess player, and robotics enthusiast. I build applications on computer vision and real-time ML. I'm a first-year Master's student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), studying Robotics, with a keen interest in vision-guided mobility systems. I work at the Autonomous Robotic Manipulation ([ARM Lab](https://arm.eecs.umich.edu/)) and am advised by [Dmitry Berenson](https://berenson.robotics.umich.edu/).

I've recently worked at [invideo](https://invideo.io), an online video creation platform, leveraging AI to help users create professional videos for marketing, promotions, and more. Previously, I interned with the [JSW Group](https://www.jsw.in/) and [Nucsoft](https://www.nucsoft.com/). 

During my free time, I like to travel, play chess, and study linguistics/language history (the growth and evolution of world languages). I'm an avid Formula Racing fan and was involved in Formula Student projects during my undergrad.
